Preface
=======

Game hacking and botting were my primary introduction to programming and
cybersecurity as a kid. I would listen to Defcon talks (like [<span
class="underline">this</span>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmwhrWxpViw)
or [<span
class="underline">this</span>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoNdhlLPX-g)),
read [<span class="underline">old
histories</span>](https://rshacking.wordpress.com/) of RuneScape
hacking, and scroll through forums like UnknownCheats, totally rapt. I
was excited by the idea that I would one day be able to understand these
exploits of these seemingly impenetrable games that I was so familiar
with. It wasn’t about wanting to cheat or make money from hacks for me –
it was about the joy of understanding a trick or exploit alone. It was
my excitement about learning game hacking that led me to [<span
class="underline">start learning
C++</span>](https://www.google.ca/books/edition/_/1bR0DQEACAAJ?hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjp3oSxo_eFAxWlkIkEHZ--CjwQre8FegQIAxAb)
in my early teens, after seeing a now deleted video from one “douggem”
on learning game hacking.

Despite being a RuneScape player in my teens and having an interest in
these hacks, I was never able to figure out how RuneScape bots were
written. While there were many public resources written about different
types of bots and how you might write a bot for an existing client,
there were little to no resources for how you would start from scratch.
This project aims to create a (private server) RuneScape bot using
Java’s reflection API to implement an “inventory dropper” – a bot
designed to automatically drop all items from the player’s inventory.
This is not only to demonstrate the process of bot creation, but also to
fill a gap in the public availability of educational resources on
RuneScape botting: to help a younger version of myself get a little
farther in his hacking goals.

Introduction
============

The goal of this project is to write a RuneScape bot using Java’s
reflection API. Reflection allows Java to access the data and methods of
Java classes at runtime, allowing us to programmatically interact with
the running game client. This project seeks to extend an archived
tutorial from the EctoTalk forum, which demonstrated the basics of
writing a reflection/injection bot client, but stopped short of applying
those techniques to write an actual bot. This tutorial will focus only
on using reflection towards the end of implementing an “inventory
dropper” bot – automating the process of dropping all items in the
player’s inventory. While simple, this will allow us to demonstrate how
reflection can be strategically used to implement a bot using fields and
methods discovered by reverse engineering the client.

Prior Work
==========

During my research for this project, the only resource I found that
shows how you might begin to write a reflection bot from scratch was
[<span class="underline">this
thread</span>](https://web.archive.org/web/20200219171455/https://ectotalk.com/index.php?threads/ultimate-guide-how-to-write-a-runescape-injection-bot.6/),
by a “Shenandoah”, on the now offline forum EctoTalk. While the post is
about writing an injection bot, it also makes use of Java reflection to
load the game’s client into our own process, giving us control over it.
It is this code from this post that this project extends. Reading posts
\#1 and \#2 up to the “Bytecode Basics” section can be considered
required conceptual reading for this article.

Like him, we’ll be using the open-source Runescape private server [<span
class="underline">2006scape</span>](https://github.com/2006-Scape/2006Scape)
as the target for our bot.

Java Reflection 
===============

There are three main steps this bot must perform:

1.  Loading the game into a bot-controlled process

2.  Reading the inventory array and inventory interface position
    information to find the location of items on the screen

3.  Triggering drop events on each of the found items in the inventory

We will implement these three steps using Java’s reflection API. The
[<span class="underline">reflection
API</span>](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/reflect/package-summary.html)
allows a program to access the fields and methods of loaded classes at
runtime. I will now give you a high-level idea of how we can use
reflection to implement of these steps:

1.  The core Game class for Runescape extends Applet (or a subclass of
    Applet). We can load this class and then use reflection to
    instantiate it. This gives us a running instance of the game,
    within our bot process, that we can further interact with using
    reflection.

2.  After finding the inventory array by reverse engineering the client
    – which is the trickiest part of the project – we can use
    reflection to make the field public and get its value. This is
    basically the same for finding the inventory positions.

3.  Drop events can be triggered in Runescape by shift-clicking on the
    items of a player’s inventory. We can programmatically create our
    own keyboard and mouse events to simulate those, using reflection
    to submit them directly to the applet’s handlers.

Technical Breakdown
===================

The code for this project can be found [<span
class="underline">here</span>](https://github.com/murdoch3/DropperReflectionBot).

In implementing the bot, I used four classes: [<span
class="underline">Main</span>](https://github.com/murdoch3/DropperReflectionBot/blob/main/src/main/java/org/example/Main.java),
[<span
class="underline">ReflectionUtils</span>](https://github.com/murdoch3/DropperReflectionBot/blob/main/src/main/java/org/example/ReflectionUtils.java),
[<span
class="underline">ReflectionBot</span>](https://github.com/murdoch3/DropperReflectionBot/blob/main/src/main/java/org/example/ReflectionBot.java)
and [<span
class="underline">BotKeyListener</span>](https://github.com/murdoch3/DropperReflectionBot/blob/main/src/main/java/org/example/BotKeyListener.java).
As Main simply creates an instance of ReflectionBot, I will skip
describing it further. Let’s break the remaining down class by class.

ReflectionUtils
---------------

ReflectionUtils provides three utility functions common to reflection
operations that access fields or invoke methods. These functions save
having to repeat the same code over and over again.

### getField

```java
public static Field getField(Class&lt;?&gt; cl, String fieldName) throws
NoSuchFieldException {

    Field field = cl.getDeclaredField(fieldName);

    field.setAccessible(true);

    return field;

}
```

The first method, getField, takes a loaded class and a string fieldName,
and returns a Field. The Field represents a variable attached to a class
that we are accessing through reflection. This Field can later be used
to get or set the field on an instance of that class. By setting the
field as accessible, we are bypassing Java’s access checking for the
field. For us, this means we can access private fields.

### setField

```java
public static void setField(Class<?> cl, String fieldName, Object object, Object value) throws NoSuchFieldException, IllegalAccessException {
    Field field = *getField*(cl, fieldName);
    field.set(object, value);
}
```

The second method, setField, takes a loaded class, a string FieldName,
an Object that is an instance of the class, and a value to set the field
to on the object. This is basically just a wrapper around getField, with
an additional call to the field’s set method. Note: if you wanted to get
a field’s value on an object, you could use the field’s get method,
similarly to the way set is used here.

### invokeMethod 

```java
public static Object invokeMethod(Class<?> cl, String methodName, Class<?>[] parameterTypes, Object object, Object[] args) throws NoSuchMethodException, InvocationTargetException, IllegalAccessException {

    Method method = cl.getDeclaredMethod(methodName, parameterTypes);
    method.setAccessible(true);
    return method.invoke(object, args);

}
```

The third method, invokeMethod, takes a loaded class, string methodName,
a list of classes representing the parameter types, an object that is an
instance of the class to invoke the method on, and a list of arguments
corresponding to the parameters. Like with the fields, this method uses
reflection to find the declared method with the given name and
parameters and bypass access checks, but now also invokes it on the
given object with the given arguments.

ReflectionBot
-------------

The job of this class is to load the game client, instantiate its main
game class, and to load the game applet into its own window. This part
is largely taken, with modifications, from the original EctoTalk post.
As such, I will only cover it briefly in this section.

After loading the client’s JAR file (JAR files being used to distribute
Java executables) we create an instantiate the client’s game class:

```java
// Load Game class
gameClass = cl.loadClass("Game");
Constructor<?> gameClassInit = gameClass.getDeclaredConstructor();
gameClassInit.setAccessible(true); // turn off access checking
applet = (Applet)gameClassInit.newInstance();
```

Then we can initialize our own JFrame, representing a window, and add
this game applet to it. This will result in the game running within our
own window.

```java
JFrame frame = new JFrame("Bot");
frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.*EXIT\_ON\_CLOSE*);
frame.setMinimumSize(new Dimension(765+8, 503+28));
frame.setLocationRelativeTo(null);
frame.add(applet);
frame.setVisible(true);
```

Finally for the game class, we initialize its fields and call its
parent’s init function, just as are done in the client’s main function.
(Since we are skipping the main class by creating the game object
directly, we have to recreate its steps.)

```java
// Recreating 2006rebotted's main class
setField(gameClass, "nodeID", applet, 10);
setField(gameClass, "portOff", applet, 0);
invokeMethod(gameClass, "setHighMem", new Class[]{}, applet, new Object[]{});

setField(gameClass, "isMembers", applet, true);
Class<?> signLink = cl.loadClass("Signlink");
setField(signLink, "storeid", signLink, 32);
invokeMethod(signLink, "startpriv", new Class[]{InetAddress.class}, signLink, new Object[]{InetAddress.getLocalHost()});

// calling this RSApplet method
invokeMethod(gameClass.getSuperclass(), "initClientFrame", new Class[]{int.class, int.class}, applet, new Object[]{503, 765});
```

At this point the applet has been created successfully, and the game
will run like normal. The last step is to attach our own key listener to
trigger on key events. This will be the entry point for our bot
functionality.

```java
BotKeyListener botKeyListener = new BotKeyListener(this);
invokeMethod(Component.class, "addKeyListener", new Class[]{KeyListener.class}, applet, new Object[]{botKeyListener});
```

BotKeyListener
--------------


BotKeyListener is the class that does the actual work of the bot. It
will listen for key presses on the applet, and upon detecting the
arbitrary start key, will use reflection to drop the items in the
player’s inventory. Reflection is used to submit the bot’s virtual key
and mouse events directly to the game applet’s key and mouse listeners.
Simulating user input in this way is the simplest way I found to trigger
actions with the game – there does not appear to be any single function
that performs an item drop that we could call.

An input method leaves us with having to find out what entities to
perform inputs on. In this case, I needed to find where the inventory
field and inventory interface information was being stored in the
client. From this, we would be able to determine the positions of each
item in the player’s inventory and use key and mouse events to trigger a
drop on it.

### Finding the Inventory Fields

While it was tricky to determine exactly how to submit the mouse events
to the game applet, most of the work of this bot was reverse engineering
the client to find the inventory fields. I wanted to find two main
things:

-   The inventory field: I was expecting to find an array or list that
    would represent the items in the player’s inventory. This would
    allow us to reflectively find which slots of the inventory had
    items in it, making the bot more efficient.

-   The inventory interface class/fields: This would be the
    implementation for the inventory’s GUI in the game. Finding this
    would allow us to reflectively find where on the screen we would
    need to click.

Starting with a clone of the [<span class="underline">game’s
repo</span>](https://github.com/2006-Scape/2006Scape), I grep’d for
“inventory”:

<img src="/assets/CreatingABotFromScratch/image2.png" style="width:8.05208in;height:3.54167in" />

Seeing that class9\_1 in Game has an “isInventoryInterface” field, I
went into the class to find what class9\_1 was:

```java
// ...
RSInterface class9_1 = RSInterface.interfaceCache[class9.children[l1]];
// ...
```

Looking now at the RSInterface class, we find that it has an inv[]
array and a method swapInventoryItems:

```java
public void swapInventoryItems(int i, int j) {
    int k = inv[i];
    inv[i] = inv[j];
    inv[j] = k;
    k = invStackSizes[i];
    invStackSizes[i] = invStackSizes[j];
    invStackSizes[j] = k;
}
```

To find out if these are the right fields, and how we can get the right
RSInterface, we can set a breakpoint on the first line of this function,
and then try swapping two items. After the breakpoint hits, we see:

<img src="/assets/CreatingABotFromScratch/image5.png" style="width:12.69792in;height:2.54167in" />

The inv array is 28 items long, which is the maximum number of items in
the player’s inventory. Further, the integers correspond to the items in
my character’s inventory – the item ID 441 represents Iron Ore, and 0
represents an empty slot. We now know that if we can find the correct
RSInterface, we can access the player’s current inventory reflectively.

To find the correct interface, we can move up the call stack to
mainGameProcessor. The call to swapInventoryItems is on a class9:  
<img src="/assets/CreatingABotFromScratch/image1.png" style="width:11.60417in;height:1.09375in" />

Which is defined by:

<img src="/assets/CreatingABotFromScratch/image4.png" style="width:9.4375in;height:0.73958in" />

3214 is the index into the static field interfaceCache used to access
the inventory’s RSInterface. Through the rest of my testing, I confirmed
that this index is consistently used between runs and throughout the
code. With this, we have found a way to access the inventory interface
and the player’s inventory reflectively.

Some GUI information is also attached to this class, including the
width, height, invSpritePadX and invSpritePadY, but we still need to
find out how to find the start coordinates of the inventory GUI
reflectively. This can be found by breaking on the following lines of
the buildInterfaceMenu:

<img src="/assets/CreatingABotFromScratch/image3.png" style="width:10.33333in;height:1.53125in" />

where i2 and j2 are the inventory interface’s x and y coordinates. As
this is being calculated outside of the class using a parent interface,
I opted to just hardcode these values for the bot.

### Performing the Inventory Drop

Now that we have found our method of input and our inventory interface
fields, we can put the bot together.

The work of the bot is in the keyPressed function. The bot starts on a
key pressed event for the forward slash key.

```java
public void keyPressed(KeyEvent e) {
    if (e.getKeyChar() == '/') {
        // ...
    }
}
```

The first event we’ll send is a key down event for the shift key. When
you click on an inventory item with the shift key pressed, the clicked
item will be dropped.

```java
// Send shift down. With shift-drop enabled, clicking on an item will cause it to be dropped.
KeyEvent keyEvent = new KeyEvent(bot.applet, 0, 0, 0, KeyEvent.VK_SHIFT, KeyEvent.CHAR_UNDEFINED);
for (KeyListener kl : bot.applet.getKeyListeners()) {
    kl.keyPressed(keyEvent);
}
```

Then, we’ll use reflection to load the interfaceCache from the
RSInterface class and then index that to get the inventory interface.
We’ll use that to access all of the fields identified in the “Finding
Inventory Fields” section.

```java
// Load the client's inventory interface

Class<?> rsInterfaceClass = bot.loadClass("RSInterface");
Field interfaceCacheField = *getField*(rsInterfaceClass, "interfaceCache");
Object[] interfaceCache = (Object[])
interfaceCacheField.get(bot.applet);
Object invInterface = interfaceCache[3214];

// Get inventory contents
Field invField = getField(rsInterfaceClass, "inv");
int[] inv = (int[])invField.get(invInterface);

Field fInterfaceHeight = getField(rsInterfaceClass, "height");
Field fInterfaceWidth = getField(rsInterfaceClass, "width");
Field fInterfaceSpritePadX = getField(rsInterfaceClass, "invSpritePadX");
Field fInterfaceSpritePadY = getField(rsInterfaceClass, "invSpritePadY");
int interfaceStartX = 569; // int i2 = class9.childX\[l1\] + i;
int interfaceStartY = 213; // int j2 = class9.childY\[l1\] + l - j1;
int invWidth = (int)fInterfaceWidth.get(invInterface);
int invHeight = (int)fInterfaceHeight.get(invInterface);
int timeBetweenActions = 100;
```

Now we’ll trigger click events to drop each item in the inventory. We’ll
loop over the rows and columns using the height and width fields of the
inventory interface. We’ll use the inventory array to check if there is
an item in the current slot. Then we’ll calculate the click location,
offset from the top-left corner of the slot. Finally, we’ll trigger the
drop by directly calling the mouseMoved, mousePressed, and mouseReleased
methods reflectively on the game’s RSApplet class. The reason why a
mouseMoved event has to be sent is that the interface has to be loaded,
which only occurs when the mouse moves over the inventory.

```java
for (int r = 0; r < invHeight; r++) {
    for (int c = 0; c < invWidth; c++) {
        // If there is not an item in this slot, move on
        if (inv[r*invWidth + c] == 0) {
            continue;
        }

        // Calculate item sprite location
        int invX = interfaceStartX + c * (32 + (int)fInterfaceSpritePadX.get(invInterface));
        int invY = interfaceStartY + r * (32 + (int)fInterfaceSpritePadY.get(invInterface));

        // Click in the middle of the sprite
        int clickX = invX + 16;
        int clickY = invY + 16;

        // Generate mouse move event to the inventory
        MouseEvent mouseMoveEvent = new MouseEvent(bot.applet, MouseEvent.MOUSE_MOVED, 0, 0, clickX, clickY, 1, false);
        invokeMethod(bot.gameClass.getSuperclass(), "mouseMoved", new Class[]{MouseEvent.class}, bot.applet, new Object[]{mouseMoveEvent});
        Thread.sleep(timeBetweenActions);

        // Mouse pressed event
        MouseEvent mouseEvent = new MouseEvent(bot.applet, MouseEvent.MOUSE_CLICKED, 0, 0, clickX, clickY, 1, false);
        invokeMethod(bot.gameClass.getSuperclass(), "mousePressed", new Class[]{MouseEvent.class}, bot.applet, new Object[]{mouseEvent});
        Thread.sleep(timeBetweenActions);

        // Mouse released event
        MouseEvent mouseReleaseEvent = new MouseEvent(bot.applet, MouseEvent.MOUSE_RELEASED, 0, 0, clickX, clickY, 1, false);
        invokeMethod(bot.applet.getClass().getSuperclass(), "mouseReleased", new Class[]{MouseEvent.class}, bot.applet, new Object[]{mouseReleaseEvent});
        Thread.sleep(timeBetweenActions);
    }
}
```


Finally, we’ll release the shift key.

```java
// Release shift
keyEvent = new KeyEvent(bot.applet, 0, 0, 0, KeyEvent.VK_SHIFT, KeyEvent.CHAR_UNDEFINED);
for (KeyListener kl : bot.applet.getKeyListeners()) {
    kl.keyReleased(keyEvent);
}
```

Demonstration

Further Work
============

This “inventory dropper” was originally part of a larger mining bot that
would mine a given ore until the character’s inventory was full, drop
all of the items, and then start again. I decided to tighten the scope
of this project to complete it in a more reasonable period of time.
Extending this solution to perform mining would require being able to
find the desired ore objects in the scene. The reverse engineering to
find these ores has not been completed yet, and appears to be
considerably more complex than just finding the inventory data due to
the obfuscation, coupling, and complexity of the client. As such, it
would be a worthwhile extension to this project, and would contribute
greatly to public resources on creating bots from scratch.
